To Install:
- Create conda environment using AI in Robotics Tutorial and install all relevant libraries (Mastery Quiz 03 Classroom Tutorial Files).

- Follow the stable-retro package tutorial, ensuring all relevant packages are installed in the site-packages folder located: your_anaconda_dir/anaconda3/envs/ai4robotics/lib/python3.8/site-packages (Link: https://stable-retro.farama.org)

- Move Super Mario Bros ROM Zip Folder (in this repository) to the following directory: your_anaconda_dir/anaconda3/envs/ai4robotics/lib/python3.8/site-packages/retro/data/stable/SuperMarioBros-Nes

- Run the following command to import Super Mario Bros Game: python -m retro.import your_anaconda_dir/anaconda3/envs/ai4robotics/lib/python3.8/site-packages/

- Move project source files (in this repostiory) to a new directory within your conda environment: your_anaconda_dir/anaconda3/envs/ai4robotics/src/Super_Mario_RL_Project

- Run the Super_Mario_Bros_RL_Train.py file to train reinforcement learning agent.

- Run the Super_Mario_Bros_RL_Test.py file to use the reinforcement learning agent (once trained). 

**Note - At this stage only sample movements can be run using the test source file**
